Below, we have described the demographics of the perpetrators and the victims, including age group and race/ethnicity. Of note, these data included many NA entries. We see that most victims and perpetrators were aged 18-44 years, were of black race, with a high number of incidents with black male perpetrators and victims [need to check with Jen that I am interpreting her description correctly]. For the purposes of simplifying race/ethnicity categorization, we lumped white Hispanic and black Hispanic individuals into a single category titled “Hispanic”.
